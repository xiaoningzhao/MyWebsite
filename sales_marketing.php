										<h3>Sales Management</h3>
										<p>Sales management approach extends from quick targeted interventions that unlock value to more holistic sales transformations focused on architecture, execution, and skill-building opportunities across the client's entire go-to-market model</p>
										<h3>Customer Lifecycle Management</h3>
										<p>Customer lifecycle management or CLM is the measurement of multiple customer-related metrics, which, when analyzed for a period of time, indicate performance of a business. The overall scope of the CLM implementation process encompasses all domains or departments of an organization, which generally brings all sources of static and dynamic data, marketing processes, and value added services to a unified decision supporting platform through iterative phases of customer acquisition, retention, cross and up-selling, and lapsed customer win-back.</p>
										<h3>Branding</h3>
										<p>Digital technology has loosened control over brand messages by creating new media channels and social networks. Mergers and acquisitions create overlapping brands within brand portfolios. And the relationships between brands and their customers have now become more open-ended as online discussions extend the brand experience after purchase.</p>
										<p>To help manage this complexity and power growth through digital advantage, we bring together deep data analysis and broad experience to take the uncertainty out of the branding process and help clients create great brands.</p>
										<h3>Digital Marketing</h3>
										<p>Digital marketing engagements are typically multifaceted, solving for specific digital marketing challenges while building ongoing client capabilities. In addition to defining new roles and responsibilities and helping develop employeesâ€™ skills, we address technology infrastructure issues and identify potential partners. We work with clients primarily in three core areas:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Harnessing digital marketing to transform business effectiveness.</li>
											<li>Optimizing the customer experience across channels. </li>
											<li>Developing and helping implement new growth models.</li>
										</ul>
