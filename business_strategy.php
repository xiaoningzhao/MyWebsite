										<h3>Business Analysis</h3>
										<p>Business Analysis is the practice of enabling change in an organizational context, by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders.</p>
										<h3>Business Planning</h3>
										<p>The business planning process is designed to answer two questions: Where are we now? Where do we want to go? The result of this process is a business plan that serves as a guide for management to run the company. Describing the most critical tasks that must be completed and the time frame for completion, a business plan allows companies to allocate resources to accomplish goals.</p>
										<h3>Strategy Execution and Evaluation</h3>
										<p>Strategy Execution requires the following activities to be undertaken:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Strategy articulation - Building consensus within the team responsible for delivery of the strategy about the outcomes to be achieved</li>
											<li>Strategy validation - Engaging with stakeholders and others to confirm strategic outcomes being pursued are acceptable</li>
											<li>Strategy communication - Convert strategic objectives into clear short-term operating objectives that can be assigned to groups for delivery</li>
											<li>Strategy monitoring - Monitor the progress of the organisation in delivering the strategic objectives</li>
											<li>Strategy engagement - Managerial interventions designed to ensure organisation successfully achieves chosen strategic outcomes</li>
										</ul>
